# IDE / Editor config


The `react-dev-inspector` could launch your local IDE/Editor application with file path, but **which one** will be open?

In fact, it uses an **environment variable** named **`REACT_EDITOR`** to specify an IDE application.

For example, if you want it always open VSCode when inspection clicked, set `export REACT_EDITOR=code` in your shell config like `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`.

```zsh filename="~/.zshrc"
...

# `code` is the command-line-tool of VSCode
export REACT_EDITOR=code
```

> **Note: Don't forget restart shell or IDE to reload the updated environment variables.**

<br />

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  **Note:** if you do NOT specify the environment variable of `REACT_EDITOR`, `react-dev-inspector` will temporarily set it to **`code`** by default.
  This means that **VSCode** will be used as the default editor. <br/>
  This setting is designed to be broadly applicable for a wide range of users.
