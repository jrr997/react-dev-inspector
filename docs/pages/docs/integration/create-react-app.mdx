# Create-React-App Integration

<SnippetDeclaration />

In this section, follow the simple setup below to integrate `react-dev-inspector` into your [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev) project.

## Setup `customize-cra`

Before setup with `react-dev-inspector`, let's assume you have use [`customize-cra`](https://github.com/arackaf/customize-cra)
and [`react-app-rewired`](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired)
to override the `create-react-app` config in your project,
because `create-react-app` doesn't provide configuration capabilities of its own.

If not yet, please follow the [customize-cra](https://github.com/arackaf/customize-cra) document to work at first.

Now you should already replace the `react-scripts` with `react-app-rewired` in your `package.json` file likes:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-app-rewired start",
    "build": "react-app-rewired build"
  }
}
```

and already have a `config-overrides.js` for `customize-cra`.

## Setup `react-dev-inspector`

Install the middleware package and add it to your `config-overrides.js`:

```bash npm2yarn
npm i -D @react-dev-inspector/middleware
```

```js filename="config-overrides.js" showLineNumbers {5,15}
const {
  override,
  overrideDevServer,
} = require('customize-cra')
const { launchEditorMiddleware } = require('@react-dev-inspector/middleware')

module.exports = {
  /**
   * react-dev-inspector server config for webpack-dev-server
   */
  devServer: overrideDevServer(
    serverConfig => {
      // https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserversetupmiddlewares
      serverConfig.setupMiddlewares = (middlewares) => {
        middlewares.unshift(launchEditorMiddleware)
        return middlewares
      }

      return serverConfig
    },
  ),

  webpack: override(
    ...
  ),
}
```
