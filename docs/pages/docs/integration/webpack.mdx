# Webpack Integration

<SnippetDeclaration />

In this section, follow the simple setup below to integrate `react-dev-inspector` into your [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) project.

## Setup

At first install the package:

```bash npm2yarn
npm i -D @react-dev-inspector/middleware
```

This package provides a **`launchEditorMiddleware`**,
just add it in your webpack config's middlewares.

> Note: make `launchEditorMiddleware` as far forward as possible before other middlewares.

For example, use with [`setupMiddlewares`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserversetupmiddlewares) in **Webpack 5** likes:

```ts filename="webpack.config.js" showLineNumbers {1,8}
const { launchEditorMiddleware } = require('@react-dev-inspector/middleware')

module.exports = {
  ...

  devServer: {
    setupMiddlewares(middlewares) {
      middlewares.unshift(launchEditorMiddleware)
      return middlewares
    },
  },
}
```

Use with [`devServer.before`](https://v4.webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserverbefore) in **Webpack 4** likes:

```ts filename="webpack.config.js" showLineNumbers {1,8}
const { launchEditorMiddleware } = require('@react-dev-inspector/middleware')

module.exports = {
  ...

  devServer: {
    before: (app, server, compiler) => {
      app.use(launchEditorMiddleware)
    },
  },
}
```
